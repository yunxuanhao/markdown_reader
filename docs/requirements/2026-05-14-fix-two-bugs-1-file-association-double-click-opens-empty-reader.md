## Goal
fix two bugs: 1. file association double-click opens empty reader instead of fil...

## Deliverable
Governed implementation artifacts, verification evidence, and cleanup receipts

## Constraints
- Do not bypass the fixed six-stage governed runtime.
- Do not widen scope silently beyond the frozen requirement document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.

## Product Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.
- The delivered output must satisfy observable behavior implied by the frozen goal and deliverable, not only internal runtime progress.
- Full completion wording is allowed only after downstream delivery truth is passing.

## Manual Spot Checks
- None required beyond automated verification for this task unless the execution scope expands to a user-visible or interactive flow.

## Completion Language Policy
- Full completion wording is allowed only when governance truth, engineering verification truth, workflow completion truth, and product acceptance truth are all passing.
- `completed_with_failures`, degraded execution, or pending manual actions must be reported as non-complete states.
- If manual spot checks remain pending, the run must be described as requiring manual review rather than fully ready.

## Delivery Truth Contract
- Governance truth: requirement, plan, execution, and cleanup artifacts remain traceable and authoritative.
- Engineering verification truth: targeted verification passes or fails explicitly; silence does not count as success.
- Workflow completion truth: planned units, delegated lanes, and specialist outputs reconcile back into the governed plan.
- Product acceptance truth: observable deliverable behavior satisfies frozen acceptance criteria before full completion language is allowed.

## Artifact Review Requirements
No additional artifact review requirements were frozen for this run.

## Code Task TDD Mode
TDD mode: required
Decision source: runtime_inference
Reason: The task includes implementation or defect-correction intent that requires code-task TDD evidence.

## Code Task TDD Evidence Requirements
- Record failing-first evidence for the changed behavior before implementation or defect correction.
- Record the green rerun that proves the targeted behavior passed after implementation.
- Map the changed behavior to targeted verification evidence; generic suite success alone is insufficient.
- If automated failing-first evidence is not appropriate, freeze and honor an explicit code-task TDD exception instead of silently skipping the requirement.

## Code Task TDD Exceptions
No code-task TDD exceptions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline Document Quality Dimensions
No baseline document quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline UI Quality Dimensions
No baseline UI quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Task-Specific Acceptance Extensions
No additional task-specific acceptance extensions were frozen for this run.

## Research Augmentation Sources
No research augmentation sources were frozen for this run.

> Fill the anti-drift fields once here. Downstream governed plan and completion surfaces should reuse them rather than restate them.

## Non-Objective Proxy Signals
- single sample pass only
- current test green only
- demo success only

## Validation Material Role
validation_only

## Anti-Proxy-Goal-Drift Tier
Tier C

## Intended Scope
scenario_specific

## Abstraction Layer Target
_author_to_declare_

## Completion State
partial

## Generalization Evidence Bundle
- cases: []
- note: add independent evidence before generalized completion claims

## Non-Goals
- Do not treat M/L/XL as user-facing entry branches.
- Do not introduce a second router or control plane.

## Autonomy Mode
interactive_governed

## Assumptions
- Interactive clarification is allowed if unresolved ambiguity materially changes implementation.

## Evidence Inputs
- Source task: fix two bugs: 1. file association double-click opens empty reader instead of fil... Deliverable: Governed implementation artifacts, verification evidence, and cleanup receipts. Constraints: Do not bypass the fixed six-stage governed runtime.; Do not widen scope silently beyond the frozen requirement document.. Update: execute plan: fix file association double-click bug and reorder download links
- Intent contract: intent-contract.json
- Runtime input packet: runtime-input-packet.json

## Runtime Input Truth
- Governance scope: root
- Root run id: 20260514T145540Z-37072ca2
- Entry intent: vibe
- Requested stop stage: phase_cleanup
- Requested grade floor: none
- Selected pack: code-quality
- Router-selected skill: systematic-debugging
- Runtime-selected skill: vibe
- Route mode: pack_overlay
- Route reason: structured_host_route_selection
- Confirm required: False

## Skill Usage
- Skill usage state model: binary `used` / `unused`.
- Used skill candidate: `systematic-debugging` is promoted only because full `SKILL.md` load evidence exists and this requirement doc adopts it as workflow authority.
- Routing, hints, recommendations, consultation, and dispatch do not by themselves prove skill use.
- Final completion must read `skill_usage.used` and `skill_usage.evidence` before claiming a skill was used.

## Skill Execution Decision
- Governed `vibe` must explicitly record whether selected skill execution is happening, stayed advisory, or remained unresolved before closeout.
- Decision state: approved_dispatch
- Resolution mode: approved_dispatch
- Notes: Bounded specialist recommendations were surfaced and promoted into effective approved dispatch.

## Selected Skill
Router candidates remain in `runtime-input-packet.json` for audit. The current work surface records selected skills here and material use in `skill_usage.used` / `skill_usage.unused`.
Rejected candidates stay out of the requirement surface.
- Selected Skill: verification-before-completion
  Role: specialist_assist; native usage required: True; preserve workflow: True
  Binding: profile=default; phase=in_execution; lane policy=inherit_grade; parallel in XL=True
  Write scope: specialist:verification-before-completion; review mode: native_contract; execution priority: 50
  Reason: overlay recommendation from 'retrieval_advice'
  Required inputs: bounded specialist subtask contract, frozen requirement context, relevant source files or domain artifacts
  Expected outputs: bounded specialist findings or code changes, verification notes aligned with the specialist skill
  Verification expectation: Preserve the specialist skill's native workflow, boundaries, and validation style.
- Selected Skill: systematic-debugging
  Role: specialist_assist; native usage required: True; preserve workflow: True
  Binding: profile=implementation; phase=in_execution; lane policy=bounded_parallel; parallel in XL=True
  Write scope: specialist:execution:systematic-debugging; review mode: native_contract; execution priority: 50
  Reason: internal specialist recommender selected a bounded specialist candidate for governed execution
  Required inputs: bounded specialist subtask contract, frozen requirement context, relevant source files or domain artifacts
  Expected outputs: bounded specialist findings or code changes, verification notes aligned with the specialist skill
  Verification expectation: Preserve the specialist skill's native workflow, boundaries, and validation style.

## Skill Routing And Usage Evidence This disclosure records selected skills and material-use evidence. A selected skill is not a `used` claim; material use requires `skill_usage.used` plus `skill_usage.evidence`.  ### discussion_routing - Skill: verification-before-completion   State: routed   Why now: overlay recommendation from 'retrieval_advice'   Loaded from: /Users/yuanxuan/.claude/skills/vibe/bundled/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.runtime-mirror.md - Skill: systematic-debugging   State: routed   Why now: internal specialist recommender selected a bounded specialist candidate for governed execution   Loaded from: /Users/yuanxuan/.claude/skills/vibe/bundled/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.runtime-mirror.md
